Reflection: What does the difference between the mean and the median
# tell you about the *distribution* of the data? (if you're unfamiliar with
# working with distribution ons, feel free to ask your TA for clarification)

The difference between the mean and median tells me that the distribution of that data is not a normal distribution but a skewed one. This dataset in particular is skewed towards the right. 

# Reflection: Does the number of protests in Washington surprise you?
# Why or why not?

The number of protests in Washington surprised me because it showed that a lot of the attendees who are at protests in this data set are from Washington, since the proportion equaled one and the number of attendees from Washington being 38,097. 

# Reflection: Looking at the `state_table` variable, what data quality issues
# do you notice, and how would you use that to change your analysis (no need
# to actually change your analysis)?

I think one thing that I noticed was that the state_table didnâ€™t provide enough information.

Reflection: Does the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020
# surprise you? Why or why not?

Yeah, I not am surprised at the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020, especially with all of the movements coming up as a result to laws on women rights and the many incidences of violence on those who are African American and POC.

# Reflection: do a bit of research. Find at least *two specific policies* that
# have been changed as a result of protests in 2020. These may be at the
# city, state, or University level. Please provide a basic summary, as well as a
# link to each article.

One policy was the defunding of police ( in Minneapolis) which would shift the funding that police departments get towards programs/organizations that will provide assistance to marginalized communities.

Another policy is advancing gender equity which is seen in the executive order in march 2021 as a result of the women rights.

# Reflection: Take a look (`View()`) your `high_level_table` variable. What
# picture does this paint of the U.S.?

It is showing that a lot of the protests that are high level purpose were civil rights related, following environment and immigration. This makes sense, especially because with the Black Lives Matter protest and immigrations laws that are impacting those who are undocumented.
