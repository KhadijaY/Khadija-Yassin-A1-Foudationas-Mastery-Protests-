Background Research 

Article 1:
[In this article, they are emphasizing how the Black Lives Matter has become one of the largest protests in the United States. It also touches on the death of George Floyd fulled the surge in movements and protests not only in the United States, but worldwide.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html)

I've included this image because it shows the face of **Geoge Floyd ** in a poster with a man holding it as it signifies George Floyd as the _fuel_to the black lives matter movement. _ They chose his photo in particular because he was killed just because of his skin color by a police officer with no form of justice and remorse.

Article 2:
[This article talks about how the increase in hate crimes, like lynching and riots towards black/african Americans which has resulted in people going out and protesting . They are protesting so that the government can create policies that protect these demographics.  ](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2021/06/09/pandemics-and-protests-america-has-experienced-racism-like-this-before/)

I chose this image that had someone carrying a sign at the protest for the acts of racial injustice towards black people, which wrote **"Anti-black is killing us"**. It shows how the racial injustices have been leading many black people to die for no reason solely because of thier _skin color _as well as experience hate crimes. 
Article 3: 
[This article talks about the years of protests and the influence it has had on policies in the past and today. It also talks about ways that people can get involved in protests.](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/the-purpose-and-power-of-protest)

This image contains a women who is speaking on the megaphone to the protests to catch their attention and speak on the **issues and possible policies **that can be _implemented _to protect lives which in this case is **black lives**. 


Analysis 
Reflection: What does the difference between the mean and the median
# tell you about the *distribution* of the data? (if you're unfamiliar with
# working with distribution ons, feel free to ask your TA for clarification)
The difference between the mean and median tells me that the distribution of that data is not a normal distribution but a skewed one. This dataset in particular is skewed towards the right. 

# Reflection: Does the number of protests in Washington surprise you?
# Why or why not?
The number of protests in Washington surprised me because it showed that a lot of the attendees who are at protests in this data set are from Washington, since the proportion equaled one and the number of attendees from Washington being 38,097. 

# Reflection: Looking at the `state_table` variable, what data quality issues
# do you notice, and how would you use that to change your analysis (no need
# to actually change your analysis)?
I think one thing that I noticed was that the state_table didnâ€™t provide enough information.

Reflection: Does the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020
# surprise you? Why or why not?
Yeah, I not am surprised at the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020, especially with all of the movements coming up as a result to laws on women rights and the many incidences of violence on those who are African American and POC.

# Reflection: do a bit of research. Find at least *two specific policies* that
# have been changed as a result of protests in 2020. These may be at the
# city, state, or University level. Please provide a basic summary, as well as a
# link to each article.
One policy was the defunding of police ( in Minneapolis) which would shift the funding that police departments get towards programs/organizations that will provide assistance to marginalized communities.

Another policy is advancing gender equity which is seen in the executive order in march 2021 as a result of the women rights.

# Reflection: Take a look (`View()`) your `high_level_table` variable. What
# picture does this paint of the U.S.?

It is showing that a lot of the protests that are high level purpose were civil rights related, following environment and immigration. This makes sense, especially because with the Black Lives Matter protest and immigrations laws that are impacting those who are undocumented. 



Critical Reflection 
How was the dataset collected and who collected the data?
They were able to collect their data from newspapers, television plateforms, and the crowd counting consortium.The person who had helped collect the data for the dataset are  Tommy Leung and Nathan Perkins who are engineers and scientists.  
What assumptions does the dataset make? List atleast two assumptions you identified. For inspiration, check out this blog post that describes one method for identifying data assumptions. 
One assumption that it makes is that there aren't as much protests in in the midwest area, but rather, there are more protests in the far east coast and west coast. Another assumption would be that the protests would mostly occur in major cities, but when I looked at the map it showed that alot of smaller cities throughout the United States have had protests, it's just not talked about as much. 
What data is missing from the dataset? Think about if there are any data points you would have liked to have seen in the dataset.
I noticed that within the images ( maps, graphes, etc) that they were all the same shade of blue. But by doing that it makes it hard for those looking at the dataset/study and come to a conclusion or understanding about it. So I would suggest having a range of colors depending on the size of the protests to make it more readable to the audience. 

Final Thoughts
What about the analysis surprised you?
The amount of protests that are based on racial injustcies and civil. It just shows that are government needs to focus on creating polcies that focus on protecting not only black lives, but the lives of the disabled, and etc. 
What parts of this analysis did you find challenging?
I think the coding part was challenging for me. 
What types of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset, but currently don't have the technical skills to do?
I think I would want to look more into at the gender of the attendees at the protests, specifically which genders are more involved within protests in states.
